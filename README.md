## Inspiration 
In the past decade, machine learning has become a new tool in the chemical engineerâ€™s toolkit. 
Indeed, driven by its execution speed, flexibility, and user-friendly applications, there is a strong, growing interest in machine learning among Chemical Engineers.
Chemical Engineers rely on models for design, research, and daily decision-making, often with potentially large financial and safety implications. 
Therefore, I decided to deal with the problem of predicting the reactivity of reaction combinations.

## Goal
Creating Machine Learning predictor of reaction yields from DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0307-8. Data from DOI: 10.1126/science.aap9112.
The Data is stored in JSON.

## What I do
Machine Learning project focused on developing regression models. 
In the project, several regression models were created and their performances were compared using metrics such as R2, MAE, and RMSE.
Models used:
* ANN,
* Lasso Model,
* Ridge Model,
* XGB Model,
* Decision Tree Model.

## Summary
The best results were achieved after optimizing the Artificial Neural Network model.
