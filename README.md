## Inspiration 

## Goal
Creating Machine Learning predictor of reaction yields from DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0307-8. Data from DOI: 10.1126/science.aap9112.
The Data is stored in JSON.

## What I do
Machine Learning project focused on developing regression models. 
In the project, several regression models were created and their performances were compared using metrics such as R2, MAE, and RMSE.
Models used:
* ANN,
* Lasso Model,
* Ridge Model,
* XGB Model,
* Decision Tree Model.

## Summary
The best results were achieved after optimizing the Artificial Neural Network model.
